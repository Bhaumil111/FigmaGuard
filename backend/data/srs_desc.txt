**2.2 Integration Test Scenarios:**

*   These tests heavily depend on the backend implementation which is outside the SRS scope. Therefore, only placeholders can be defined.
    *   **INT-TC-001:** Verify interaction between the sign-up page and the user database (successful user creation).
    *   **INT-TC-002:** Verify interaction between the login page and the user database (successful authentication).

*   **Sign-Up Page:**
    *   **SU-EC-001:** Test with extremely long name.
    *   **SU-EC-002:** Test with SQL injection attempts in input fields.

*   **PERF-TC-003:** Verify that the "Remember me" functionality does not significantly impact login time.

**2.5 Security & Compliance Scenarios:**

*   Since security aspects are outside the detailed scope of this SRS, these are general placeholder suggestions.  Actual implementation-specific tests would be required.
    *   **SEC-TC-001:** Verify password storage security (hashing and salting).  (Requires backend knowledge).
    *   **SEC-TC-002:** Verify protection against brute-force attacks on the login page (account lockout). (Requires backend knowledge).

    *   **SEC-TC-004:** (Accessibility) Verify keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
    *   **SEC-TC-005:** Verify that the connection uses HTTPS.

**3. Completeness and Clarity Notes:**

*   The SRS mentions component-based development, and the Figma file should be checked to verify that the input field components (Frame 55, 56, 57) are used consistently across both pages.
*   Backend integration and authentication logic are not within the scope of this SRS, which limits the ability to define comprehensive integration and security tests.
*   The report assumes that detailed validation rules (e.g., password complexity, email uniqueness) are handled on the backend, and this document focuses on the visual representation and basic functional validation.
*   The Figma design file is crucial for UI-based testing and verifying visual adherence to the specified requirements. Any discrepancies between the SRS and the Figma design should be addressed and clarified.
*   The URL for "terms & policy" and "forgot password" needs to be provided to facilitate proper testing.
*   Stubs or Mocks must be created to simulate the Google and Apple sign-up/login flows as these services are external dependencies.

This report provides a detailed and structured analysis of the provided SRS, enabling the creation of comprehensive test scenarios for the desktop sign-up and login pages. It should be used in conjunction with the Figma design file for a complete testing strategy. Remember to update this report as the design or requirements evolve.
