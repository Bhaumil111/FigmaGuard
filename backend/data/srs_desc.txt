## Software Requirements Specification Analysis and Test Scenario Generation Report

This report analyzes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for desktop sign-up and login pages, detailing key requirements and generating test scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

**1. System Requirements Breakdown:**

**1.1. Functional Requirements:**

*   **Sign-Up Page Functionality:**
    *   Users can create an account by providing their name, email address, and password.
    *   Users can agree to terms and policy via a checkbox with a hyperlink to the relevant documents.
    *   Users can sign up using their Google or Apple accounts.
    *   A visual separator distinguishes password-based sign-up from social login options.
    *   The page displays a background image.
    *   The page displays the title "Sign up".
*   **Login Page Functionality:**
    *   Users can log in using their email address and password.
    *   Users can choose to remember their login for 30 days via a checkbox.
    *   Users can access password recovery via a "forgot password" link.
    *   Users can sign in using their Google or Apple accounts.
    *   A visual separator distinguishes password-based login from social login options.
    *   The page displays a background image.
    *   The page displays the title "Log in".
    *   The page displays a "Welcome back!" message.

**1.2. Non-Functional Requirements:**

*   **Performance:** Pages must load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions.
*   **Usability:** Pages must be easy to navigate and understand for a broad user base.
*   **Security:** User credentials must be handled securely (details beyond visual design are out of scope).
*   **Accessibility:** Design must adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., color contrast, keyboard navigation).
*   **Maintainability:** Code must be well-structured and documented.

**1.3. Constraints:**

*   The implementation must adhere to the Figma design.
*   The "Poppins" font family must be used.
*   Component-based development is encouraged, leveraging predefined components (Frame 55, Frame 56, Frame 57).
*   Compatibility with modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**2. Test Scenario Generation:**

**2.1. Functional Test Scenarios:**

*   **Sign-Up Page:**
    *   **SU_TC01:** Verify successful sign-up with valid name, email, and password.
    *   **SU_TC02:** Verify that the "terms & policy" link navigates to the correct location.
    *   **SU_TC03:** Verify successful sign-up initiation via the "Sign Up" button. Note: the actual sign-up process is outside the scope, but the button click action should be verifiable.
    *   **SU_TC04:** Verify the initiation of the Google sign-up flow upon clicking the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **SU_TC05:** Verify the initiation of the Apple sign-up flow upon clicking the "Sign in with Apple" button.
    *   **SU_TC06:** Verify correct rendering of the "Or" separator.
    *   **SU_TC07:** Verify correct display of the background image.
    *   **SU_TC08:** Verify correct display of the "Sign up" title.
    *   **SU_TC09:** Verify behavior of input fields, including placeholders "Enter your name", "Enter your email", and "Name"
    *   **SU_TC10:** Validate that the background color of the "Sign Up" button is #EDF2F7.

*   **Login Page:**
    *   **LI_TC01:** Verify successful login with valid email and password. Note: the actual login process is outside the scope, but the button click action should be verifiable.
    *   **LI_TC02:** Verify that selecting the "Remember for 30 days" checkbox persists the login for 30 days (functionality will need backend verification).
    *   **LI_TC03:** Verify that the "forgot password" link navigates to the password recovery page.
    *   **LI_TC04:** Verify the initiation of the Google login flow upon clicking the "Sign in with Google" button.
    *   **LI_TC05:** Verify the initiation of the Apple login flow upon clicking the "Sign in with Apple" button.
    *   **LI_TC06:** Verify correct rendering of the "Or" separator.
    *   **LI_TC07:** Verify correct display of the background image.
    *   **LI_TC08:** Verify correct display of the "Log in" title.
    *   **LI_TC09:** Verify correct display of the "Welcome back!" message.
    *   **LI_TC10:** Validate that the background color of the "Login" button is #EDF2F7.
    *   **LI_TC11:** Verify behavior of input fields, including placeholders "Enter your email", and "Name".

**2.2. Integration Test Scenarios:**

*   **INT_TC01:** Verify that clicking the "Sign Up" button on the sign-up page initiates the account creation process, eventually leading to the login page or appropriate success message. (This will require coordination with backend tests).
*   **INT_TC02:** Verify the integration with Google and Apple login flows. (This requires mocking or stubbing the external authentication services).
*   **INT_TC03:** If a "Sign In" link exists on the Sign-Up page and a "Sign Up" link exists on the Login page, ensure navigation between these pages functions correctly.

**2.3. Edge Case Scenarios:**

*   **EC_TC01:** Test with extremely long names, email addresses, and passwords to check for buffer overflows or other unexpected behavior (primarily related to visual rendering - ensure no overflow).
*   **EC_TC02:** Test with special characters in name, email address, and password fields to ensure proper handling.
*   **EC_TC03:** Test with blank input fields to ensure that no action happens or that appropriate client side validation errors appear.

**2.4. Performance Test Scenarios:**

*   **PERF_TC01:** Measure the page load time for both sign-up and login pages under normal network conditions.
*   **PERF_TC02:** Measure the response time of button clicks (e.g., "Sign Up", "Login") under normal load.

**2.5. Security & Compliance Scenarios:**

*   **SEC_TC01:** Verify that the password field masks the entered password.
*   **SEC_TC02:** (Out of scope for this SRS, but a note for future expansion) - Verify that user credentials are not stored in plain text on the client-side. (This requires backend testing).

**3. Completeness and Clarity:**

This report provides a detailed breakdown of the SRS, covering functional, non-functional requirements, constraints, and a comprehensive set of test scenarios. The scenarios are categorized and named for easy identification and tracking. This information, combined with the Figma design description, provides a robust foundation for generating a complete test plan. The scenarios focus on testing the front-end presentation and interactions as detailed in the SRS. Backend interactions are noted but require separate test planning.
